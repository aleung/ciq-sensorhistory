# Sensor History

A ConnectIQ widget for Garmin VivoActive3 series watch

Time logger for anything you need to do periodically, e.g. take medicine, feed your baby. Remind you the elapsed time since you last did it.

The data is directly stored on the watch. It stores up to 10 records and old records will be removed.

## Use
Main Screen:
- Tap on the yellow button at the top to add a new log entry.
- Tap other space to show history

History Screen:
- Scroll up and down to see all ten entries
- Tap or swipe right to go back

Settings can be adjusted in Garmin Connect mobile app or Garmin Express.
- Time out: in minutes. Show progress bar according to elapsed percentage.
- Alert: Wake up the widget on timeout if it's not running in foreground. The behavior on wake up differs on watch model, usually there is a vibration if the watch is not in Do Not Disturb mode.
